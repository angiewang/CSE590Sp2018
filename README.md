## L01-RealtimeGraphViewDemo
Demonstrates how to visualize real-time data in [Graph View](http://www.android-graphview.org/). To use the Graph View library in your own projects, simply add "compile 'com.jjoe64:graphview:4.2.1'" to your build.gradle file under your app directory and Android Studio takes care of the rest. See the [Getting Started](http://www.android-graphview.org/download-getting-started/) page.
